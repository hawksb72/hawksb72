#### Network Administrator | Python Newbie | Cyber Security 


<p>"Hello and welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a passionate network administrator with an insatiable appetite for learning new and challenging technologies. My journey has led me down the programming rabbit hole, where I have been immersing myself in the world of Python.
I believe that there is always a need for programming logic in our lives, and I am excited to explore the endless possibilities that Python has to offer. My goal is to continue to hone my newbie programming skills and leverage them to create efficient and effective solutions for complex problems.
In addition to programming, I have recently taken on the exciting challenge of learning about cyber security. As technology continues to play an increasingly important role in our lives, it is crucial that we understand the risks and take steps to protect ourselves. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest cyber security trends and techniques, and I am committed to applying this knowledge to create secure and reliable systems.
Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. I am excited to continue sharing my journey and learning experiences with the community. Let's build and explore together!"</p>
